Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez underpaid to rent the “Tax the Rich” dress at the 2021 Met Gala. Four years after the fact, the panel determined Friday that the $1,000 the progressive congresswoman paid to rent the outfit wasn’t a fair rate and that she must hand over an additional $2,733.28 to designer Aurora Janes. The finding stems from ethics rules governing the acceptance of gifts by elected representatives, which cover “a gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance or other item having monetary value.” While the committee concluded Ocasio-Cortez had been mindful of those regulations and that her aides made efforts to explain the rules to the designers, it found Janes “may have lowered costs” nonetheless. Given the buyer’s price for the dress stood at $18,837.30, the committee estimated the rental cost, combined with other fees, should have been $3,724.04, and therefore said “it would be appropriate” for Ocasio-Cortez to pay the additional fees.Read it at New York TimesRead more at The Daily Beast.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-07-26 14:25:43","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://thedailybeast-thedailybeast-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/v2//BSFRHI6GMZE2DG7MN6KWYMZVJI.jpg?auth=75fc3aba079634e2c80770f402fe9cf6e9b8da3e85b5451c72d258a0613b2dc8&height=1604&smart=true&width=2852","video_url":null,"source_id":"thedailybeast","source_name":"The Daily Beast","source_priority":1258,"source_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/thedailybeast.png","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["politics"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","ai_content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"e21dc39354d406faf85f637a987fddf6","title":"Lin-Manuel Miranda to Turn 10th Anniversary of 'Hamilton' Play into an Illegal Immigration Fundraiser","link":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/07/26/lin-manuel-miranda-to-turn-10th-anniversary-of-hamilton-play-into-an-illegal-immigration-fundraiser/","keywords":["lin-manuel miranda","immigration","broadway","hamilton","entertainment","new york city"],"creator":["Alana Mastrangelo"],"description":"Lin-Manuel Miranda plans to turn the 10th anniversary of the Broadway play \"Hamilton\" into a fundraiser for illegal immigration services.The post Lin-Manuel Miranda to Turn 10th Anniversary of ‘Hamilton’ Play into an Illegal Immigration Fundraiser appeared first on Breitbart.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-07-26 14:25:19","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/AP19012118061874-640x480.jpg","video_url":null,"source_id":"breitbart","source_name":"Brietbart","source_priority":1399,"source_url":"https://www.breitbart.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/breitbart.png","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["entertainment"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","ai_content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"fddaa9f380d2eed039f32988e2578cdc","title":"First time in 148 years!

An agency spokesperson said the figures could shift slightly in the coming weeks.“Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organisation and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,” the agency said.Earlier this year, the Trump administration’s proposed Nasa budget put a return to the Moon and a journey to Mars front and centre, slashing science and climate programmes.The White House says it wants to focus on “beating China back to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars”. China is aiming for its first crewed lunar landing by 2030, while the US programme, called Artemis, has faced repeated delays.Nasa is still run by an acting administrator after the administration’s initial pick to lead the agency, tech billionaire Jared Isaacman — endorsed by former Trump adviser Elon Musk — was ultimately rejected by the Republican president.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-07-26 14:33:19","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/26191704db4a885.jpg?r=191942","video_url":null,"source_id":"dawn","source_name":"Dawn","source_priority":7267,"source_url":"https://www.dawn.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/dawn.png","language":"english","country":["pakistan"],"category":["top"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","ai_content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"b2c6cb8676fa0266a1e8c2480987d218","title":"Trump leveraging power of his office and inside the Tour de France | Hot off the Wire","link":"https://www.stltoday.com/news/nation-world/article_d80a4157-2ce1-597d-b626-d4a1d1382be9.html","keywords":["hot-off-the-wire","donald trump","podcast","dcc","lee-national","associated press"],"creator":["Lee National Newsroom, The Associated Press"],"description":"🎧 Get a recap of recent financial, health and general interest stories through this special edition of our Hot off the Wire daily news podcast.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-07-26 14:30:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/80/d80a4157-2ce1-597d-b626-d4a1d1382be9/6883e135a0610.preview.jpg?crop=1737%2C912%2C0%2C74&order=crop%2Cresize&resize=1200%2C630","video_url":null,"source_id":"stltoday","source_name":"Stltoday","source_priority":7882,"source_url":"https://www.stltoday.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/stltoday.png","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["world"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","ai_content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"5cde981a1fce698715875b25c4e6ab64","title":"Trump leveraging power of his office and inside the Tour de France | Hot off the Wire","link":"https://dailyprogress.com/news/nation-world/article_35215db5-167f-5819-86c1-ead0019cc16a.html","keywords":["dcc","hot-off-the-wire","podcast","lee-national"],"creator":["Lee National Newsroom"],"description":"🎧 Get a recap of recent financial, health and general interest stories through this special edition of our Hot off the Wire daily news podcast.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2025-07-26 14:30:00","pubDateTZ":"UTC","image_url":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailyprogress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/52/35215db5-167f-5819-86c1-ead0019cc16a/6883e12f8c05d.preview.jpg?crop=1737%2C912%2C0%2C74&order=crop%2Cresize&resize=1200%2C630","video_url":null,"source_id":"dailyprogress","source_name":"The Daily Progress","source_priority":9706,"source_url":"https://dailyprogress.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/dailyprogress.png","language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","ai_content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","duplicate":true},{"article_id":"72a2c7ab5cf271e60e443b5f9531ba59","title":"RFK Jr. cares more about french fries than US farms","link":"https://www.salon.com/2025/07/26/rfk-jr-cares-more-about-french-fries-than-us-farms/","keywords":["food","rfk jr.","fast food","all salon","commentary","farms","maha","starbucks"],"creator":["Ashlie D.
